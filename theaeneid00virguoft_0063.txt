360·400] BOOK V.

360] ‘ Taken by the Danaans srom Neptune’s sacred portal where it was
hung.' It is strange that V. should omit to add how it afterwards came
into Aeneas's hands. Can a line have dropped out?

[ζῶ-ᾤ The boxing-match. Dares, a Trojan, alone comes forward‚
and so c airns the championship.]

363 animus praesens] Servius paraphrases, fortis, ac si diceret, si adsit
quis plenus animi, almost ‘ pluck,' ‘ prompt energy.'

366] ‘ For the champion hero a heifer, his horns all ribbons and gold’
(Bowen; slightly altered, to preserve the alliteration). The version happily
preserves the ambiguity in V. If we construe ‘ ribbons intertwined with
gold ’ (a hendiadys), there is no authority for such fillets; if ‘ with fillets
and gilded horns ’ (the usual decoration of victims), the language is forced.
We are osten inclined to think that Vergil, like Lord Tennyson, would, is
asked, have declined to paraphrase himself.

. 368] ‘ Dares in his giant strength displayed his face to all.’

372 victorem] ‘Champion.’ C. proves almost conclusively that immani
corpore belongs, not to Buten, but to se serebat ; cf. Aen. viii. 198, Illius
atros Ore vomens {gnis magna se mole ferebat. Amycus was king of the
Bebryces, a Bithynian tribe on the borders of the Euxine. His boxing-
match with Pollux forms the subject of the twenty-second Idyll os
Theocritus. ι

374 fulva] An otiose epithet, of which there are very few in V.

380 excedere palma] ‘ Were shy of the prize,’ ‘ refused to enter for the
prize.’

382 tum] For position C. compares εἶτα after participles

385 simul] See Aen. i. 559.

[387-423. Acestes urges Entellus, an aged Sicilian boxer, to enter the
ring. After some demur he consents, and produces a terrible pair of
gauntlets. Dares objects, and Entellus consents and to fight with the
gauntlets of equal weight assigned by Aeneas.]

387 gravis :graviten

389 frustra] ‘ And that for nought’—requires to be separated in trans-
lation in order to connect it with the following sentence.

391] ‘ Where now is that God of ours whom thou didst vainly vaunt of
as thy master ? ' So Henry, and C. nearly, who translates, ‘ VVhere are we
to look now sor ? ’ Eryx (see l. 24) is said by Servius to have challenged
all strangers who entered his land to box, and slain them when vanquished,
till he was finally killed by Hercules.

395 sed enim] See on Aen. i. 19.

397 fuerat] For erat, as in x. 613, emphasises the loss.

improbus nte] ‘ Your shameless boaster there.'

400 nec dona moror] ‘Of gifts 1 recl< not ’3 moror in this sense is

always found with a negative.
