brother of Nereus, a personification of the angry sea, haunting shoals and
rocks. His choir‚ Plzorcz' exercitus of l. 824, are the sea-monsters.

Panopeia] One of the Nereids. Heyne suggests with much probability ι’

a military vest of purple flowed, livelier than Meliboean.' Cf. Lucret. ii.

directness, blends these in one, as though he were merely relating the story
instead of describing the picture, and so puzzled the earlier commentators.]

viii. 649 : Illum indignanti similem, similemque minanti Aspiceres (of the
