Vergil, who before had been known as a poet only to
his intimates and patronS, leapt into public fame3 and
Tacitus tells us that on one occasion as he entered the
theatre‚ the whole house rose to do him honour as they
did to Augustus, Of Vergil's personal history during
these years we know very little. He had been received
into the coterie which gathered round MaecenaS, and

had formed close friendships with literary men—with
Horace, his junior by five yearS, who speaks of him as
the kindest and sincerest of men, with Tucca and

finished of all his workS‚ and the greatest didactic poem
in all literature. His chief residence during these
years was at Naples.1 His biographer tells us that the
poem was undertaken at the instigation of MaecenaS‚
but the poet can have needed but little prompting.
A sarmer’s son, and country-bred‚ he loved the country
as only those love it who have been forced, like Cowper
and Coleridge, to exchange it for a town life. The
theme was a congenial one, and gave full scope for
Vergil's special gifts and genius: his keen powers of
observation and description, his love of nature—not
indeed the passion of a modern poet, Byron‚ Shelley,
or Wordsworth‚ who love nature in her wildest moodS,
but a genuine delight in rural sights and soundS, his
yearning for ‘ a philosopher’s life in the quiet woodland
wayS‚’ his patriotism‚ his‘ antiquarian lore, and his
