NOTES To VERGJL’S AENEJD [ss-109*

88 incendebat auro] ‘Made his scales to burn like gold‚’ literally
‘with gold.’ From incendebat we must supply some verb like notabant, ·.
distinguebant, to govern terga.

89] Repeated from iv. 701 with the variation of iacit for trahit, though
one MS. reads trahit here.

nubibus] Either ‘in the clouds‚’ or ‘ casts upon the clouds ’—p0etical
dative of destination 3 cs. it clamor caelo, l. 451.

90 agmine] ‘train’ ; cf. Geor. iii. 423.

91 tandem]:lente.

94 instaurat] ‘Renews,’ especially used of a repeated ritual, or the
renewal of an interrupted ritual.

95 geniumne loci] Each spot, according to Roman mythology, was
haunted by a spirit of its own, so that Varro says that in Latium there are
as many gods as trees, Cf. Milton, On the Asorning os Christ's Natz‘vz‘ty— '

‘ From haunted spring and dale,
Edged with poplar pale,
'l'he parting genius is with sighing sent-¹

The genius is often represented in sepulchral monuments under the
form of a serpent. Servius refers to a curious superstition (arising pro· ¹
bably from the fact of serpents often being found in tombs) that the ’
human marrow when decomposed generated a serpent.

incertus esse putet]—indirect deliberative subjunctive. ,

famulumne parentis] ‘ His sire's familiar’ (or attendant). Ladewig j.
quotes Valerius Flaccus, iii. 459, placidi quas protenus angues, Umbrarum
famuli linguis rapuere coruscis. These attendant animals maybe connected j
with totem worship. 3

96 binas] Distributives are used in poetry for ordinals. Cf. Buc. iii. 30. ξ
Swine, sheep, and oxen are sacrificed, as in the suovetaurilia. ¹

97 nigrantes terga iuvencos] Black victims are offered to the shade ’
or to the infernal gods. Cf. Tibullus, iii. 5. 53, Interea nzgrras pecudes ’
promittite Diti. ,

lap the blood of the victims slain by Odysseus. 1

[104-12},. The games : first, the entries for the boat-tace]

105 Phaethon] In Homer an epithet of the sun (Ἠέλιός φαέθων), so the
sun himself.

serena luce] ‘ In unclouded light,' ablat. of circumstance.

109 circo] It is quite in V.'s manner to mention incidentally the course,

and afterwards (l. 289) to describe it as a new feature of the scene. K,
however, takes it of the circle of the gazing crowd.
