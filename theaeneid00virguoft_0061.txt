313·329] BOOK V.

313 tereti subnectrt fibula gemma] ‘ A clasp sastens it with its polished
gem.' Whether the gem forms the clasp, being cut like a stud, or the
buckle is adorned with a gem, is left doubtful.

[315-361. Nisus leads, Salius is second, Euryalus third, till Nisus slips
in a pool of gore, but in his fall contrives to trip up Salius, and so secures
the victory for Euryalus. Nisus and Salius are both consoled for their
defeat by extra prizes.]

316 corripiunt spatia] Cf. l. 145. Spatia, properly ‘the laps of the
race course, here ‘the course.'

limen] The technical word is calx, the chalk-line or starting-point.

317 effusi nimbo slmiles] ‘Streaming forth like rack of rain.’ In
Geor. iv. 313, the bees fly out ‘ut aestivis effusus nubibus imben’
‘N‘imbus implies a confused mass. Insequitur nimbus peditum, vii. 793.’

simul ultima. signant, etc.] Ultima spatia szgrnant oculis, ‘their eyes
set upon the goal.' Henry quotes Lucian (of a good runner), καὶ διάνοιαν
ὑποτείνας πρὸς τὸ τέρμα. Cf. Philippians iii. 13, 14.

omnia corpora] A periphrasis, like the Homeric δέμας. Morris
renders quaintly, ‘ before all shapes of men.’

319 fulminis alis] Thunderbolts are represented on coins with wings.

320] Cicero, Brutus 47, Duobus summis Crasso et Antonio, L.
Philippus proximus accedebat, secl longo lamen intervallo proximus. It
would seem that the phrase was proverbial before V. crystallised thern in
a hexameter.

321] Construe, Deinde insequitur spatio post eum relicto.

323 quo sub ipso] ‘Close behind him.’ With sub in this sense the
accusative is commonet.

324 calcemque terit iam calce] ‘ And is pressing heel to hee1.’ If V.
is more graphio, Homer is more exact ε Il. xxiii. 763, αὐτὰρ ὄπισθεν ἴχνια
τύπτε πόδεσσι.

325] ‘ And did more laps remain, he would start to the front and pass
him, and turn a doubtful race to a close victory,' literally, ‘leave in the
lurch him who is now doubtful—likely to run a dead heat.’ So Turnebus,
followed by Conington, and so we must translate if we retain amszgrcumque,
the reading of all the Mss. Moreover‚ the phrase seems to us thoroughly
in V.’s style, an alternative rendering of a single fact. But later commen-
tators‚ as Sidgwick‚ characterise this as ‘a very harsh and obscure con-
struction, and read ambssmumve, construing it as a neuter, ‘ or would
leave it a dead heat.’ This makes good sense, but it is unlikely that all
the Mss. should have perverted the easier to the more difficult reading.

81 supersint, transeat] Present‚ as though the reader were seeing the
race run.

329 ut rorte] ‘As it chaneed that‚’ almost=‘where by chance’
(cf. l. 388), though we need not, with XVagner, say that V. uses ut sor
