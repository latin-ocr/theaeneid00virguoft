NOIES TO VERGJL'S AENEID [700-732

[700-718 Aeneas half inclines to settle in Sicily, but Nautes bids him
steer straight on for Italy, and leave the feeble and waverers to found a
town in Sicily.]

701] The two notions of hesitating between alternatives‚ and revolving
many thought5‚ are combined.

704 unum] ‘ Pte-eminently‚’ as in prose with a superlative.

706-7 are parenthetical. Nautes was wont to give oracular replies (to
prophecy) concerning what the wrath of heaven boded, and what the law
of Fate required. If we read haec responsa, the words must=responsa
de lzis, or iis quae, etc. ; but hac, se. arte, the reading of one cursive, is
a very probable emendation.

quae portenderet] Indirect interrogative. Future events fall into two
great classes: those deterrnined by the inevitable order of fate, and those
affected by the caprice and intervention of special deities (Henry).

708 isque] Resumes the sentence begun in l. 704.

solatus] See on l. 627.

709 tranunt retrahuntque] ‘ The ebb and flow of Fate.’ We are but
waifs borne on a resistless tide; man’s happiness consists in a wise
passiveness. ’

713 amissis superant qui'navibus] The superfluous crews of the burnt
ships.

716 quidquid] For neuter, compare German alles for alle.

718 permisso nomine] Sc. α le, ‘ with 'thy permission.’ Acesta,
afterwards Segesta or Egesta, the modem Castellamare. See on l. 38.

[719-745 Aeneas is perplexed. That night Anchises appears to him in
a vision, and bids him follow Nautes’ advice, but before reaching Latium
he must visit the shades and learn the future.]

719 incensus] Of any mental agitation‚ as grief, iv. 360, ix. 500.
720 tum vero] Used in Livy and Sallust after a parenthetical clause,

like Greek εἶτα.
animo] Inferior MSS. read animum. There are plenty of parallels in

V. for both constructions.
721 et] ‘And now.' Cf. Aen. ii. 781, et terram Hesperiam venies,

‘ and then.'

722 facies] ‘ The image or phantom‚' not the shade of Anchises, which
was in Elysium, but a Jove-sent vision.

726 classibus] Dafive, as Ovid, H’roides, xiv. 130, proves ε quam
mortem fratri depulit z'p5a tulit.

728 quae pulcherrima] The transference of the epithet to the relative
clause serves to emphasise it-——‘ follow his rede, for it is right fair.’

730 gens dura atque aspera cultu] ‘ A rugged and hard-faring race.’
This description is elaborated in a fine passage, Aen. ix. 609.

732 Averna] The grotto near the lake of Avernus was the reputed
entrance to the shades ; hence Averna stood for the shades themselves.
