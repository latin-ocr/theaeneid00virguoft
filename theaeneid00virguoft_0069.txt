360-583] BOOK V.

560 term=tres1 Cf. Aen. vii. 538, quinque greges illi balantum quina
redibant armenta, where the distributive means not ‘ five sor each flock,'
but ‘ five herds, one for each flock.' Here ‘three leaders for each troop'
would not suit the subsequent division of each troop into two.

vagantur] ‘ Range,’ or, as Pope would have rendered, ‘ expatiate.'

562] ‘Ride freely in the separate bands (lit. the body being broken up), and
each with their marshal.’ I follow Ladewig in distinguishing the magistri
from the ductores: the latter are boy captains, the former instructors or
drill-sergeants‚ who superintend the manoeuvres. L., however, translates
‘'with a pair of marshals to each.’ Those who, like C., take magistri as
‘ captainS‚' overlook its use in l. 669.

564 referens] ‘ Recalling,’ ‘ handing down.’ Aeneas is called after his
grandfather, according to the Greek custom.

Pontes] Son of Priam, siaiu, according to V. (Aen. ii. 526), at the sack os
Troy, but, according to Cato (Orzgrines), founder of the town of Politorium.

566 vestig-ia primi pedis] :posterna Candida permulcens liquidis
vestzgia lymphis, Catullus 62, 162 3 and Propertius, iii. 6. 11, uses primas
palmas for ‘ finger-tips. ’

568 A compliment to Augustus, whose mother was an Atia.

575 pavidos] ‘ Their shy approach.'

576 veterum ora parentum] ‘ Ancestral features,’ not merely ‘ of their
parents-²

578 lustravere] ‘ Has made the round of the throng under the eyes of
the sires’ (Bowen). Macrobius gives circumire as a synonym‚ and though
lustrare can only mean ‘to review,’ V. doubtless intends to suggest
lustratio, the being reviewed.

580] ‘ They gallop off right and left (pares, ‘ in pairs,' zle. one squadron
to the right and one to the left), and still in triple array (terni, ‘ keeping
their triple arrangement ⁹) deploy their columns, and, at the signal to
return, wheel about and charge each other.’ A diagram will make the
movements clear :—
