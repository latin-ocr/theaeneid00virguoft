NOTES TO VERGJL’S AENEJD [137-151 ”

 

lust os same.’ The conjunction of the physical and mental sensae of
intentus would not be so remarkable in Latin as it is in English.-

137 haurit] ‘ Drains,’ cause a rush of blood from the heart. The last
verse and ahalf are repeated from Geor. iii. 105.

138 pavor] Rather ‘ excitement,’ ‘ ssutter‚’ than ‘ sean’

139 finibuS, etc.] ‘ Eaeh srom his station starts with a bound.’ Finibus ν
fixes the meaning to the vessels, rather than the crews. Ribbeck has the
very prosaic emendation funibus.

Terra tremit, fugereserae.

141 adductis, eto] ‘ The shallows foam beneath their sturdy stroke.’

142 pariter] ‘ Side by side ⁹ ς others construe ‘ in time.'

143 rostris tridentibus] ‘ trident-shaped (or three-forked) beaks.’ ⁴

144] The simile os a swift·sailing ship to a car urged at full speed is from ;
the Odyssey, xiii. 81: ‘ And even as on a plain a yoke of four stallions ¹*
comes springing all together beneath the lash‚ leaping high and speedily i
accomplishing the way, so leaped the stern of that ship.'—Butcher and Ξ
Lang’s Trans. It would naturally occur to V„ as the boat-tace takes the
place of the chariot-race in Homer.

145 corripuere] ‘ Devour (or scour) the plain.’ The aorist of repeated
action in similes.

146] ‘ Not so headlong the team o’er which the charioteers shake the
flowing reins, as they hang forward to lash their steeds.' ·

147 in verbera] ‘ For blows‚' ‘ to deal blows‚’ Cf. Aen. xi. 284, quantus ¹
in clypeum assurgat, ‘ how he dashes down the spears with his shield.’

150 colles resultant] A Vergilian variation of the plain phrase, Geor.
iv, 50, vocisque ‹fflnsa resultat imago, Cf. lVordsworth, T 0 joanna—-

        
   

‘ The rock, like something starting from a sleep,
Took up the lady's voice, and laughed again ;
That ancient woman seated on Helm-crag
XVas ready with her cavern ; Hammer-scas,
And the tall steep of Silver-how, sent forth ⁶
A noise of laughter ; southern Loughrigg heard,
And F airfield answered with a mountain tone ;
Helvellyn far into the clear blue sky
Carried the lady's voice ; old Skiddaw blew
His speaking-trumpet ; back out of the clouds
Of Glaramara southward came the voice;

And Kirkstone tossed it from his misty head.'

V. has something of the same feeling as Wordsworth for the poetry of
sound.

151 primis elabitur undis] ‘ Glides to the sore on the waves,' literally'·
‘ shoots out on the front waves.'
