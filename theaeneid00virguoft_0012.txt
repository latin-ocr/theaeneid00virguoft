LIFE OF VERGJL.

dates from what we may call his college dayS‚ he bids
a long farewell both to rhetoric and poetry, yet casts a
longing look behind at his much-loved MuseS. It is
then that he must have steeped his mind in Theocritus,
whom he imitated so closely in his Bucolic5‚ and laid
the foundation of his profound acquaintance with the
whole range of Greek poetry, from Homer and Hesiod
down to Apollonius Rhodius and the AlexandrineS.
In native poetry he was most influenced by Ennius, by
LucretiuS, his senior by thirty yearS, and after him by
Catullus, who died about the time of Vergil's first visit
to Rome.

but he had probably returned to his Transpadine home
when the Civil VVar between Caesar and Pompey broke
out in 49 B.C.‚ and he passed the troubled years which
followed in quiet retirement on his father’s farm. In
41 B.C.‚ the year after the battle of Philippi, the lands
round Cremona were parcelled out to their veterans by
the victorious triumvirS, Antony‚ OctavianUS‚ and Lepi-
dus, and Vergil was ejected from his paternal estate.
At the intercession of Alfenus Varus (to whom the
sixth Eclogue is dedicated), and the poets Gallus and
Polli0‚ Vergil was restored, and the first Eclogue is a
grateful tribute to OctavianUS, who henceforward re· ζ

Shelley‚ we may say that he was ‘cradled into poetry 2⁶.
