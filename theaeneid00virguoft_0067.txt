498·528] BOOK V.

498] ‘Last at the bottom of the helm Acestes lay sunk.’ The copula
is not logical, but quite in V. ’s manner; cf. obvius adversoque occurrit,

en. x. .
Α 500 Πέἒέε incurvant] :flectunt et incurvant. Cf. Aen. i. 69, submer-

sas obrue puppes.

504 venit] ‘ Goes home.’

arbore mali] ‘The tree that formed the mast‚' or ‘the wood of the
mast.' In Aen. x. 207 arboris used by itself for a mast.

505 timuit. exterrita pennis] ‘The wings flutter with terror'3 one os
V. ’s exquisite terms for the commonplace tremuit.

508 alta petens] ‘ Ainiing alost,’ used differently in Geor. i. 142.

pariterque ocu-los telumque tetendit] C. translates, ‘ levelled his
arrow as he had already levelled his eye’ ; but this irresistibly reminds us of
‘And first began to eye his pipe and then to pipe his eye.' Rather ‘ sighted
the mark along his levelled shaft ' ; literally‚ ‘brought his eye and arrow
in a line.’

512 notos atque in nubila] The reflex use of the preposition 3 cf. Aen.
ii. 654, vi. 416, 696.

515] Homer in the parallel line keeps the constant epithet τρήρωνα.
V. with his usual elaboration substitutes laetam, and fills in the picture
with the ‘ clapping wings.’ Note too in the following lines V. ’s sympathy
with the poor dove.

521 pater] See on l. 130. Here we may preserve the force of the word
in this position by translating ‘an old man's craft.’ Pater according to
the older quantity, so pqu, Buc. ix. 66.

522] ‘When lo! there flashed upon their eyes a marvel hereafter to
prove a mighty sign ; vast issues taught its meaning, and awful seers long
after interpreted its import.’

523 monstrum] A neutral word, sometimes favourable, as in Aen. ii.
680. Here Aeneas takes it for a good sign, and it was only in aster ages
that seerS, wise after the event, understood its true purport. Endless ink
has been spilt in conjectures 3 that it foreshadowed the Punic wars which
began for the possession of Sicily is as good a guess as any, and we might
support it by Horace’s comparison of Hannibal—ceu flamma per taedas.
Sera may mean ‘ too late,' like the adverb sero.

625 liquidis ln nubibus] ‘ In liquid air,' or, as our older poets would
, have expressed it, ‘through the buxom air,' answering in the simile,
l. 527, to tenues in ventos. So Geor. i. 404, liquido sublimis in aere,
and above, radit iter liquidum. Bowen's version, ‘through cloud-
lets of glory’ (after Henry) is wholly un-Vergilian. Nor need nubibus
present any difficulty; we in the same way use ‘clouds’ loosely for

· ‘ sky.'

527 refixa] The stars were supposed to be nailed to the firmament.
528 crinemque volantia ducunt] ‘ With bright locks streaming
behind’3 literally‚ ‘and trail their locks as they fly.’ In the parallel
