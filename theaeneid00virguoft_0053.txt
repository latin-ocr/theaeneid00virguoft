Ι 112-136] BOOK V.

112 talenta] There is a v. l. talentum, but l. 248 each ship receives a
talent’s weight of silver.
¹ can-lt commissos ludos] ‘ Proclaims the games begun‚’ more graphic
than the present committi ludos, though the tense may be partly due to
the absence iu Latin of a present passive participle.

114 pares] ‘ As competitors‚' ‘ matched together sor the race’ z does not
imply equality or swistness.

116 Pristim] The ship would be named from its figure-head, some
sabulous sea-monster, ‘ the dragon.’

117] V. is doubtless incorporating the fanciful derivation of the genea-
logists Alnestlzeus from μέμνημαιΣΛᾸ-ηιηιῖιις from memini. Great Roman
families tried to trace their descent from the Trojan settlers‚ and Juvenal
uses T roiugenae in mockery sor ‘ aristocrat5.'

117 Memmi is gen. sing„ not nom. pl.

⁴119 urbis opus] ‘A floating town,' literally ‘the work of a eity‚' ἵζε.
‘a construction as huge as aeity.’ So Statius, Theb. vi. 87, speaks of a
pyre as montis opus, ‘ huge as a mountain.' Ovid, Fasti vi. 641, urbis
opus domus unafuit. Cf. use of instar: Cic. Verr. ii. 5. 34, §89‚ Quae
(navis) si in praedonum pugna versaretur urbis instar habere inter illes
piraticos myoparones videretur.

1 19 tripnci versu] ‘ With three tiers.' A trireme is an anachronism.

120 terno consurgunt ordine remi] Adds nothing to the sense, but
makes us dwell upon the picture of tier rising above tier, after V.'s
manner.

122 magna] Because Centauro=nave Centauro.

123 caerulea] Cf. iii. 432, Scyllam et caeruleis canibus resonantia saxa.

[124-158. The course for the boat-tace is marked out. They start.
Gyas first, Cloanthus second, then Mnestheus and Sergestus nearly even.]

125 011m] ‘At times‚’ properly ‘at that time‚’ being the locative os
olle=ille. Cf. the'use of quondam, Aen. ii. 367, quondam etiam victis
redit in praecordia virtus.

127 tranquillo] ‘ In calm weather,’ an ablative of time 3 tranquillum
being often used as a substantive.

128] ‘VVhere sea-mews love to bask them in the sun.’ So Persius,
v. 179, has aprici senes.

130 pater] The word is emphasised by separation from ‘ Aeneas ’—‘ as
father of his people‚' ‘ like a kindly chieftain.'

131 unde scirent] A final clause, ‘that they might know where to
turn.' Note the iteration, as in l. 120.

134 populea] Sewius gives the explanation that the popIar was brought
by Hercules from the shades, when he went to setch Cerberus, and hence
appropriate to funeral games.

136 intentaque, etc.] ‘ Arms are strained to the oar, ears sor the signal
suain, and bounding hearts beat high with trembling hope and the keen
