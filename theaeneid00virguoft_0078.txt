NOTES To VERGJL’S AENEJD [832-853

sinistroe, etc.] ‘Now on the lest, now on the right, they loosened the
belly of the canvas, turning now this way, now that, the points of the yards
alost i ' With wind ast both sheets were equal, but when the wind came
srom one side the sheet on that side would be paid out, this ‘ loosened the

belly of the canvas ’ on the right, the other sheet being drawn in. At the ·

same time the yards would have to be braced, sorward on starboard, ast
on port side. Cornua antennarum (here called bracchia are the extremi·
ties of the yard-arms. Note the omission of the first nunc.

832 sua] Cf. l. 54.
834 ad hunc] ‘ By him ² :ad huius exemplum.

835 metam] Generally taken as a metaphor from the meta or turning-
point of a race, but Conington shows from Cicero and Pliny that
night was regarded as the shadow of the earth, ‘in shape like a meta
(cone) or inverted top ⁷ (Pliny), and a learned allusion like this is in V. ’s
manner.

839 dimovit . . . dispulit] By his passage through them.
840 somnia] We should have expected somnum, but the two words
are more nearly allied than ‘ dream and sleep ' in English.

844 aequatae] ‘ Balanced‚' and so ‘steadily aft.’

datur hora quieti] ‘ 'Tis the hour of rest,' the happy motto of a famous
picture of Turner’s. C. shows that these seemingly simple words are
susceptible of three (he might have said four) interpretations, but prefers
on the whole, ‘ The hour is sacred to rest,'

845 furare labori] ‘ Steal from toil,' like the French valer ὰ quelqu’un,
but this dative is properly confined to persons.

847 vix attollens lumina] ‘ Scarce deigning a glance.’

848] Benoist well compares Lucretius ii. 557, Infidz' maris insidias
viresque dolumque . . . Subdola cum ridet placidi pellacia ponti.

850] ’ΧἯηῐ l and shall I trust Aeneas to treacherous breezes, duped so
oft by them and the salse smiles of a sair sky! ’ The difficulty lies in the
et. Ladewig takes auris as an amative, and supplies monstro as object
to credam. Conington explains by a mixed construction: ‘Shall I trust
Aeneas to the treacherous gales' ; then, instead of ‘and to the wiles
of the sky by which I have been deceived‚’ is substituted ‘and de·
ceived so often,' etc. The version Ι offer comes to much the same,
but I prefer to make f. α. as it were the hinge of the two sen-
tences, or, in other words, to take it both as a dative and ablative—
‘to trust to false gales, false gales and salse skies, by which I have been
fooled.'

853 nusquam] Virtually=nunquam‚ but has its proper force, ‘looking
nowhere else.’

amittebat] For lengthening of alternate in arsi, see Aen. i. 3083
quid enim, parenthetical‚ like Greek τί γὰρ, ‘ forsooth.’
