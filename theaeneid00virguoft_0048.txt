NOTES To VERGJL'S AENEJD [14· -31 Ξ

14 deinde] Belongs to iubet. Cf. Aen. vii. 135, Szc deinde effatus 1

frondenti tempota myrto Impl1cot‚ and l. 400.

15 colligere arma]‘ To make all tight and trim’ :secure the loose .

i

tackle‚ and reef the sails (not‘ surl them,' as the subsequent line shows). ³

So in Aen. vi. 353 arma is the gear or tackle ofa ship.

validis incumbere remis] ‘ Bend to the strong oar'=bend with a will ’-

to the oars.

16 obliquatque, etc.] ‘ And trims the sails to catch the wind sidewaysss
sinus] ‘ The bellying sail.'

17 auctor] From augeo, one who adds his weight to, i.e. guaranteeS. ·

Translate : ‘ were my surety.’

sperem contingere] In prose: sperem fore ut contingam.. Cf. Aer‘z. ii.
657, iv. 305, iv. 337 ; though in these passages, except the last, we have
posse, which contains the idea of futurity. So, iv. 487, promittit solvere.

19 transversa] ‘Athwart our course,’ adverb in Ecl. iii. 8, transversa
tuentibus hircis.

20 in nubem cogitur aer] ‘ The air thiekens into clouds.' Accord-
ing to the physical theory of the Romans, clouds consist of condensed air.
Cf. Cic. de Nat. Deorum, ii. 39, Illarz'fim'tz'mus ae'r . . . fusus et extenu-
atus sublime fertur, tum autem concretus, in nubes cogitur (quoted by
Henry).

21 tendere tantum] ‘ For such a struggle’; contra probably modifies
both verbs3 cf. ix. 377. Kennedy translates: ‘we cannot breast the

wind, or even proceed on our course’; but thus understood the clause
falls rather flat.

24] ‘ The friendly coast of thy brother Eryx.’ Eryx, the eponymous
founder of the town, was by legend the son of Venus and Butes, one‘of
the Argonauts, and so half-brother of Aeneas. Thucydides (vi. 2) regards
the natives of Eryx and Egesta as descendants of fugitives srom Troy, and
on Mount Eryx there was a famous temple of Venus. Note the unusual

double epithet, justified because fraterna littora Erycz's=l. fratris E. ⁴

Sicanos, properly the aboriginals of Sicily, but here=Sz'culos. «
25] ‘ If, indeed, I rightly recall and 'retrace the stars observed upon my

way,' i.e. on the way from Sicily to Carthage, Aen. i. 34. Sidgwick notes
the accumulated expression in the manner of the poet.

26 sic poscere ventos] ‘ This bearing of the winds.’
28 flecte viam velis] ‘ Turn thy course and taek. ' Cf. tendit iter velis,
Aen. vii. 7.

sm: -esse potest: potentia13 and so optem, though quo consecutive
would of itself require a subjunctive

29 demittere] ‘To turn to land‚’‘ to put in.’ Compare the force of -

de in devenire.
