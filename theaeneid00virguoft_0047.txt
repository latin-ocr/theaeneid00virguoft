NOTES TO AENElD—BOOK V.

[1·34 Aeneas, pursuing his voyage, is overtaken by a storm, and makes
for Eryx, a harbour· of Sieily.]

1 Interea] While the events related in the last book are happening.

medium iter] ‘XVas steadsastly pursuing his mid-sea way‚’ not ‘was
half-way on his voyage.’ Cf. Aen. iii. 664, graditurque per aequor iam
Ι medium, and iv. 277, mortales visus medio sermone reliquit.

2 atros Aquilone] ‘ The billows darkening beneath the northern blast.'
Aulus Gellius notes ii. 30, Austris spirantibus marefieri glaucum et caeru—
leum, aquilonibus obscurius utriusque. Eryx lies N.W. of Carthage ;
therefore they must have sailed almost in the teeth of the wind, unless we
take Aquilo for any stormy blast. Compare, however, Dido's reproach‚
iv. 310, Et mediis properas Aquilonibus ire per altum.

3 Elissae] According to the legend, the original name of Dido.

5] ‘ The thought of the bitter pangs of an outraged heart, and the
knowledge of what a woman in her frenzy can dare, fill the Trojans' souls
with a train of sad forebodings.' Vergil says: ‘the pangs of outraged
love suggest sad sorebodings,' but ‘ the thought eff the pangs,’ etc. , is readily
supplied from the context.

notum] The neuter of the participle used as an abstract noun. Cf.
Livy vii. 8, Diu non perlitatum (the continued absence of favourable
omens) tenuerat dictatorem3 Livy xxvii. 37, Liberatus religione mentes
turbavit rursus nuntiatum iufantem natum esse.

polluto] Polluere is to defile or violate something holy, as the bonds of
love. The word shows that Vergil’s sympathies are not all with his pious

, hero.

8, 9] Repeated‚ with a slight variation, from Aen. iii. 192. Vergil
follows, but sparingly, the Epic tradition of tags.

10 om] Archaic sor illi.

caeruleus] ‘ Dark blue‚’ ‘ dark.’ Ovid has caerulei Plutonis equi:

Gray’s ‘ coal-black steed.’

imber] ‘ Rain·cloud.’

11 inhorruit u'nda. tenebris] ‘The wave shivered with the gloom’;
inhorresco expresses the ruffling of the sea, and suggests the terror of the
black squall.

13 quianam] An archaic form, as Quintilian, lnstit. viii. 3, tells us;
a strengthened form of quia.
