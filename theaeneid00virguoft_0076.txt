NOTES TO VERGJL’S AENEJD [763-796

763] See on Aen. i. 66, and cf. Par. Lost, i. 171—

‘ The sulphurous hail
Shot after us in storni, o'erblown, hath hid
The fiery surge-¹

764 creber aspiranszcrebescens] ‘ Freshening, Aen. iii. 530.

766 complexi inter se] ‘In mutual embrace one more day and night
is spent.’ ‘ The notion is partly that of making the time pass more
slowly by crowding so much into it (comp. i. 748), partly that of actually
prolonging the time before sailing' (C.). ·

768 numen has rather more MS. authority than nomen, and is con· ,

firmed by l. 849. Either ‘ a repulsive power,' or ‘the very name
repulsive,' makes good sense.

769 fugae] ‘ Of wanderers.'

773 ex ordine] Like ordine, l. 53, applies both to the sacrifice and the
loosing their moorings.

775 procul] ‘ Apart‚’ on the lofty prow.

777, 8] Repeated from iii. 130 and iii. 290. Ribbeck needlessly inverts
the order of the two lines.

[779-826 Venus appeals to Neptune to defend them from Juno’s relent-
less persecution. Neptune reassures her, recalling former instances of his
favours to Aeneas, and promises to bring all but one safe to Italy. He

straightway lays the angry waters‚ gliding over them in his chariot with
his sea train.]

782] Cf. Horace, Odes, iii. 29. 59: ad miseras preces decurrere.

784] The change of subject is harsh sor V.

785] exedisse] Like a vulture preying on the heart on its quarry.
Servius na'ively notes ‘ muliebriter dictumst

786 traxe] For syncopated form, see on Aen. ii. 201.

788 Causas tanti sciat illa furoris] ‘ Be it hers to know the motives
of such rage‚' z‘.e. I do not envy her the feelings which have produced
such rage3 see Aen. i. 23. C. paraphrases : ‘ Let her be well assured that
she has reasons, for I know of none '—whieh is flat.

790 quam molem excierit] ‘ What a tempest she raised.’ Moles, as in
i. 134, may be ‘ mountains of waves‚' or used more colloquially for
‘ troubles.' We can preserve the ambiguity in English.

792] The hemistich helps the rhetoric z ‘ And all this lawless fury was
exercised in thy domam, a personal insult to thee.' From this and other

instances we may well doubt whether V. ever intended to complete all 'v

these imperfect lines.

793] per scelus actis] ‘ Driven along the path of crime,’ ‘ goaded to
crime.’

796] ‘As for the temnant, O let them trust in thee, and sail in safety
o'er thy waters.' Quod superest, if the passage stood alone, we might take,
in the common Lucretian sense, ‘moreover‚’ ‘sor the rest‚’ the essential
