ξ 433-465] BOOK tf.

433 ingeminant] Transitive, as in l. 457. Others make it intransitive,
asin Geor. i. 333, and supply subject volnere. This change of subject is
awkward‚ but we can then take dant sonitus in its natural sense, ‘ resound, ’
instead of ‘ produce a sound‚' a somewhat forced phrase. The balance is
very even, but an obvious imitation of Statius Theb. i. 418, (quoted by
C.), turns the scale in favour of the first rendering : Iam crebros ictus ora
et cava tempora circum obnixi ingeminant.

435 errat] ‘ Fly ’3 ‘ stray’ or ‘ wander’ would fail to give the intended
motion, as of a wasp or fly buzzing about a man.

437] ‘Stands stiffly planted in one set posture.' There is the same
difficulty in rendering gravis as in l. 178. Here it implies both solidity
and the stiffness of age. msu]‘ A striving‚’ so ‘a tense posture. ’ Cf.
Lucan, Phars. iii. 612. Nisu quo prendente haeszt.

438‘ Only with bend of body and watching eye dodging the volley of
blows.’ Corpore and extre seem both technical terms of the ring3 Cic.
Catilin. i. 6. 15, Tuas peti'twnes . . . parva quadam declenatzone et, ut
aiunt, corpore effitgz'. For exit, cf. Aen. xi. 750, vim viribus exit. The
accusative presents no difficulty, the meaning of the verb overrides the
form. Tela, a bold but obvious metaphor, like volnera. These two lines
(437-8) seem to contradict the previous ones (433—6), but they describe
two phases of the fight ε first a bout of wild hitting, then Entellus standing
on the defensive.

439 ine] ‘ The other.’

molibus] ‘ A siege train.'

440 sedet circum] :obsz'det.

1 sub armis] :armatus.

443 ostendit], ‘ put forth.' It had been kept close to his body on guard.

444 ictum venientem a vertice] ‘ The downward blow. ’

446 ultro] Not only did he waste his bIOW, but undid himself besides.
See on l. 55. Morris renders well ‘ overborne wimal)

447 gravis graviterque] An echo of κεῖτο μέγας μεγαλωστί, ll. xvi.

448 quondam] ‘At times‚' ‘ostem’ Cf. Aen. ii. 367, quondam etiam
victis redit z'n praecordia virtus.

cava] ‘ Hollow with age,' but probably suggests a further reference to
the hollow sound of the fall.

450 studiis] Cf. l. 148.

454 vim miscitat ira] ‘While anger fans his fire'; vim, ‘violence,·'
distinguished from vires, ‘strength,' in the next line. Ira is ablative‚ as
in xii. 108.

‚ 455 pudor] ‘ Honour.’ Properly‚ like αἴδως, ‘ a sense of shame.’
ξ 457 1110] Cf. l. 335. We may give the force by ‘now again,’ or ‘ now
full with the left.'

460 pulsat versatque] ‘ Batters and buffets.’

466] ‘Dost not see here another might than mans and that the gods
