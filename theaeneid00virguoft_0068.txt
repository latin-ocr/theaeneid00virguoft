NOTES To VERGJL’S'AENEJD [su-539

description of a falling star (Aen. ii. 693) we have facem ducunt, and in
Geor. i. 367, Flammarum longos a tergo albescere tractus.

534 exsortem ducere honorem] ‘ To draw a special prize.’ Ducere
carries out the metaphor contained in exsors, ‘ exempted from the lot by
which common soldiers divided the spoiL’ Greek ἐξαίρετος. Cf. Aen.

’π

viii. 552, ix. 271. If we read honores with the best MS. we must translate: “

‘that you, though excluded from the eompeffition, should have a prize.’
535 Anchisae munus] ‘A present bestowed on Anchises,' as the con-
text shows. C.'s suggestion, ‘a present from the ghost of Anchises,’ is
wildly improbable. '
537 in magno munere] ‘ As a lordly gift’3 in, ‘in the case of,’ as
Aen. ii. 541, Talis in hoste fuit Priamo3 here ‘in the class of,' munere
being used generically. Tantarum in munere laudum (viii. 273), ‘ in cele-

bration of such exploits,’ which the commentators quote, is hardly parallel. 't

Cisseus] The father of Hecuba, hence called Cz‘ssaeis.

538 monumentum sui et pignus amoris] Rather than m. et p. amoris j

sui, as the parallel iii. 486 shows.

541 praelato invidit) honori] ‘ Grudges his superior reward‚' a natural
variation on ‘ envies the man who is preferred for a reward.’

543 Proximus ingreditur donis] ‘ Comes next in the prize—giving,' but
the marching past with the prize may be suggested.

[545-603 After the games comes a parade of the youths, who, headed .-
by Ascanius, perform elaborate cavalry evolutions, of which the ‘Trojan -

games’ at Rome still preserve the memory.]

549 cursus instruxit. equorum] ‘ Has prepared the manoeuvres of his
horse,' a variation of equitatuve.

550 dic . . . ducat avo turmas] ‘ Bid him lead forth his squadrons in
his grandsire’s honour. '

553 pariterque, etc.] ‘A brilliant company, as they ride their well-
reined steeds in even ranks before their fathers’ eyes.’

556] ‘The locks of all are duly bound with chaplets of trim leaves.’
Cf. vii. 751, Fronde super galeam et filici comptus oliva, which shows that
wreaths were worn over the helmet, and ll. 67 3-4 prove that Ascanius wore
a helmet at the ‘game.' The difficulty is how to reconcile coma pressa

corona with the helmet. C. suggests that the wreath was worn just below ·-j
the helmet so as not to interfere with it, and if we imagine them all with ν

long-flowing locks such as Ascanius had (Aen. x, 137), this is quite ⁴

possible. At any rate, it is better than to suppose V. to have been

napping, and have forgotten, at l. 673, what he had written in l. 556‚— τΔ
the only alternative offered, for Henry’s ‘close-cropped circular tonsure' ·

is out of court. The chaplets were probably of olive; cf. Geor. iii. 21,
Ipse caput tonsae foliis ornatus olivae.

in morem] ‘ According to rule,’ ‘ all in the same fashion.’

559 flexilis obtorti circulus auri] A periphrasis of torques.
