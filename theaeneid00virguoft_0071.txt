610-634] BOOK V.

virgo] In its emphatic position, may be an allusion to the light soot os
a maiden goddess.

613 acta] Greek ἀκτή, a borrowed word.

614] Their hearts were turned to sorrow by their mourning (probably
professional‚ as C. suggests), and by association of ideas they are led to
think of their own lot, wanderers and sojourners like Anchises, with no

hope of rest but the grave. A very natural touch.

615] ‘Alasl what perils of waters‚ what leagues of ocean for weary
folk to pass.’ Vada suggests the dangers of shallow waters. For infin.
see Aen. i. 37.

620 Tmarii] Tmaros is a mountain in EpiruS. From Aen. iii. 292, we
leam that Aeneas visited Epirus.

621 cui] Beroe is probably the antecedent.

fuissent] It comes to the same thing whether we make the subjunctive
'causal—Iris took the form of Beroe, because she had been a matron of
position-or virtual oblique ι ‘ I will take the form of Beroe, a matron of
position.'

624 traxerit] Causal.

626 septima vertitur aestas] ‘Is turning to winter.’ Aeneas arrived
at Carthage in the seventh summer after the sall of Troy (Aen. i. 755),
and must have left some time in the autumn3 but it is difficult to
reconcile the chronology with the year said to have elapsed after
the burial of Anchises (l. 46), which year must have been spent at
Carthage.

627 cum ferimur] C. quotes from Cicero, Multi anni sunt cum ille in
aere meo est, which is not strictly parallel. Here we have a combina-
tion of Septem anni sunt cum (during which) ferimur, and Septimus est
annus cum (ex quo) Troiam liquimus.

627 freta. and terras] Accusative of extension after ferimur. See
Aen. i. 524.

saxa sideraque emensae] ‘ Encountering desolate rocks and the
influence of stars.' The imitation of Valerius Flaccus, v, 197, Tot
freta, tot dure properantia sidera passis supplies a commentary. The
time os emensae is really the same as that offerimur, but V. often uses
thus loosely the past participle, especially of deponent verbs. Cf. ii. 514,
Incumbens arae atque umbra complexa Penates.

629] ‘We chase Italia's flying shores.' A fine metaphor, like Tenny-
son’s ‘ The untrodden world whose margin fades for ever and for ever as
1 move.'

631 iacere muros] ‘ To lay walls,’ like iacere fundamenta.

633] ‘ Are we never more to hear of a city of Troy? ’ Muros, the walls
osa town 3 moenia includes the buildings.

634 xanthum et Simoenta] As they had found the names of these
rivers of the Troad given by Helenus to the streams of Epirus, Aen.
ιιι. 350.
