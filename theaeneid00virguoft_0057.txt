crag.’ The sound well echoes the sense. AIurex, a rocky splinter like a
mussel-shell.

207 magno clamore morantur] ‘ Stop dead amid loud shouts’=incre-
pitant moram. The suggestion thrown out by C., and strangely adopted
by H. A. J. Munro, ‘ morantur:inhibent, ‘ back-water,' is improbable.

211 agmine remorum celeri] ‘ Quickening the stroke.' Agmen, either
‘the ordered ranks ’ of oars, or, more probably, ⁶ the ordered movement ' ;
so in Geor. i. 322, of the steady downpour of rain3 Aen. ii. 782, of the
downward tide of a river, and cf. l. 90. Celeri is predicative.

ventisque vocatis] ‘ Winds that came to his call '=ventis secundis, not
an ablative absolute.

212 prona. petit maria] ‘ Makes for the sliding seas, and speeds home
o’er the open main.’ Pronus, ‘falling or slipping downward,' so of a
downhill easy course. Here the sea is described as pronum, because it
offers a clear course home. Henry, who takes it differently, quotes
Ovid, Heroid. xviii. 121—

Haec quoque si credas, ad te via prona videtum
A te cum redeo, clivus inertis aquae.

213-218] The point of the simile lies in the first line, and the first part
serves mainly ‘in the way of ornament and picturesque suggestiveness.'
But Mr. Sidgwick is hardly justified in regarding all but the last line as
poetical surplusage. It is true that Mnestheus has suffered no perils by
water which correspond to the flutterings of the startled dove, but he too,
like the dove, escapes from the strain and struggle of the contest, and
glides on his liquid way.

214 rudi] ‘ Nestlings‚' as Aen. xii. 475, nidis loquacibus.

215 fertur in arva volans] The main feature of the picture is given
first 3 the details, though prior in tirne, follow.

218 ipsa] ‘ Of herself,' ‘like a thing of lise.’ Gossrau quotes Cic. De
Or. i. 33: Concitato navzjgio cum renngres inhibuerunt, retinet tamen ipsa
navis motum et cursum suum, intermisso impetu et pulsu remorum.

220 111 scopulo alto . . . brevibusque vadis] ‘In the shallows formed
by the high rock’3 ‘high,’ not as towering in air, but rising from the
bottom of the deep sea. So Hemy, who quotes Aen. i. 115, in brevia ct
Syrtes.

22 5 iamque] Second word in the sentence, whereby solus is emphasised.
Cf. Aen. iii. 588.

227 ingeminat] Cf. Aen. ii. 747.

229] ‘These scorn the thought os letting slip the honour that is theirs
by right, and the prize (as good as) won, and would even barter life sor
same3 these are fed (spurred) by success; they are strong through belief
in their strength.' In xii. 49 we have a variation, letumque sinas pro laude
pacisci. In the one case the bargainer gives lise, in the other he takrs death
in exchange sor farne.
