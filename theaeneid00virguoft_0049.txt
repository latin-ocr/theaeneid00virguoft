33-52] BOOK V.

line is borrowed from Lucretius i. 13 5, Morte obita quorum tellus com-
plectitur ossa.

33 zephyr-l] The gentle western breeze, distinguished from the vespere
ab atro consurgunt venti of l. 19.
. gurgite] ‘ The vasty deep,' often used by V. simply as a synonym of
the sea, but may be meant to suggest the ground-swell aster the storin.

[3 5·41 Acestes welcomes the Trojans.]

35 excelso] There is another reading en celso, but, as Conington
remarks, V. would have avoided the ambiguity by writing e celso.
Whether we render ‘on the top' or ‘from the top' is a matter of
indifference.

36 adventum sociasque rates] A hendiadys.

37 horridus in iaculis] ‘Grim with darts,’ one of V.’s recondite
phrases for ‘armed with bristling darts.' The phrase is imitated by
Tacitus, He'st. ii. 88, tergis serarum ec ingentibus telis horrentes.

Libystidis ursae] Lz'bystz's for Libyca is peculiar to Vergil. N aturalists
tell us that there are no bears in Libya, but it was enough sor V. that
Herodotus vouches for them.

38] Acestes’ mother was Egesta or Segesta3 the Crinisus or Crimisus,
a river of Sicily where Timoleon defeated the Carthaginians.

40 gratatur reduces] Sc. esse. This is better than to render ‘welcomes
them corne back‚' as there is no authority for grator with an accusative.

gaza agresti] ‘Rustic opulence,' a sort of oxymoron; C. compares
Geor. iv. 133, dapibus mensas onerabo! inemptis.

[42-71 The next day, which is the anniversary of Anchises' funeral,
Aeneas announces his intention of celebrating games in his father's
honour.]

42 primo oriente] ‘ At earliest dawn'.' For oriens see l. 42. The
ablative may, however, be instrumental. ‘ The morrow routing the stars
by help of the rising sun ’ is quite in Vergil's manner.

44 tumun ex aggere] ‘ From a raised hillock ’ : a definitive genitive.

45 Dardanus] 'l'he grandparent of the race, was the son ofJupiter.

49] ‘ The *full tale of moons has completed the circle of the year.’

50 sic di voluntis] Resers rather to acerbum than honoratura ς, ⁴ a day
of mourning‚ but 1 bow to the will of heaven.'

’ 51] Literally, ‘VVere I spending this day an outcast on Gaetulia's quick·
sands, or surprised <by its advent) in the Argive Sea or the city of Mycenae,
yet would 1 pray‚' etc. The Argive Sea (the Aegean) and Mycenae are
coupled by et, as forming one common danger from Greek soes, and an
alternative to the danger from African foes.

52 deprensus] Half the commentators understand ‘ overtaken by a
storm,’ as in Geor. iv. 421, but then we should expect some corresponding
word like captus with et urbe Mycenae.
