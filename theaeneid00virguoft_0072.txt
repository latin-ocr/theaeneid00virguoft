NOTES TO VERGJL’S AENEID [638-664 ·

638 tempus agi res] ‘ The hour for action.’ The commoner- construc-
tion with tempus is the active infinitive, as glandes stringere tempus.

639 tantis mora prodigiis] ‘ Such portents brook no delay‚’ ‘are not
to be trifled with.’ Dative, as fieret vento mora ne qua serenti, Aen.
iii. 473, shows.

640] These blazing altars would not be ready to hand, did not heaven
appl'OVC OUr COUHSCI.

[641-699 Iris flings the first torch herself. Her divinity is discovered by ,

one of the matrons, and she vanishes in a rainbow. The frenzy-stricken
crowd fire the fleet. The news reaches the circus. Ascanius gallops to
the rescue and sobers the matrons, but the flames still rage, till at Aeneas's
prayer Jupiter sends a storm of rain, and saves all but four of the ships.]

642] ‘And uplisting high her hand, she strongly whirled the flashing ⁴<

brand and hurled it.’ Note the metrical effect of the dactyl followed by
a full pause. C. compares xii. 730, etserz‘t.

646 vobis] ‘ Look you ’ 3 an ethical dative.

648 spiritus] ‘Haughty air,’ coupled by Cicero with ira. For the
outward signs of divinity, cf. Aen. i. 327, 405.

650 dudum] ‘ Even now.'

655 ambiguae]=amb1grentes, rarely used in an active sense.

miserum amorem] ‘Craven clinging.' C. compares misere amare,

‘to be desperately in love,' of the comic writers3 but such a meaning is .

unlikely in V. For regna co-ordinated with amorem, see note on l. 5. ⁷
656 fatis] ‘ With the voice of fate.’

658 fuga secuit arcum] ‘ Fled describing a rainbow arc,’ like secare .,
viam. ‘The rainbow comes and goeS,’ and had better be conceived as ζ

different from that by which Iris descended. .-
660 focis penetralibus] ‘ From the household hearth‚' τῖε. of the houses
near the shore. Ξ
662 immissis habenis] ‘The fite-god gallops o’er the benches.’ The ἕ

metaphor is justified on the same principle as Shakespeare's ‘take arms

against a sea of troubles.' It is a coin so worn as to have become a
counter.

663 transtra. per] See on l. 512.

pictas abiete puppes] ‘Painted prows (or ships) of pine.’ The pecu·

liarity of the phrase is that abiete depends in sense on puppes, but in con· t
struction on pictas. We may best explain by saying that pictas sufficiently :-
suggests the sense of ‘made’ (factas, textas, have been proposed) as to Τ
justisy the ablative. Turbidus imber aqua, l. 696; duros obiice postes, ᾖ
xi. 890, quoted by the commentators‚ are not nearly so bold. Virgulta Ξ

sonantia lauro, xii. 522, is a nearer parallel.

664 cuneos theatri] A bold transference of the wedge-shaped blocks of 1
seats in a Roman theatre to the meadow slopes whence the games were ,

viewed.
