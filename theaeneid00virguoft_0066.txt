No TES TO VERGJL’S AENEJD [467-496 ἲ

have turned against thee Ρ ’ This rendering is supported by an imitation

in Valerius Flaccus, iv, 18 5, iam iam aliae vires maioraque sangvine nostro ·

vincunt fata Iovis, another strength,—superior to mortal nature, wins
the day in the fight between Amycus and Pollux. Quoted by C. The
alternative renderings are (1)‘ that the powers of Entellus are different to
yours‘j (2) ‘that your powers are other than what they were at the
beginning of the fightss ‘that the balance of power is changed] But

Henry well observes that either interpretation would imply reproof, not 2

consolation (mulcens dz'ssctzs l. 464).

467 Cede deo] ‘Yield to the will of heaven, rather than‘ to Eryx, the Ἴ

patron god of Entellus)

468- 470] Closely imitated from Il. xxiii. 695- -9, the line αἶμα παχὺ ’

πτύοντα, κάρη βάλλονθ’ ἑτέρωσε is translated, with a superadded horror
which would have disgusted Greek taste, but tickled the ears of the
patrous of ‘the bloody circus.’

476 servetis revocatum] ⁴ You have rescued and are preserving.'

481 ‘Thundering down upon earth with a shudder, the bull drops
dead’ (Bowen). The same seat is recorded by Ranke of Caesar Borgia
(Roman Popes, i. ch. 2).-—Henry. For monosyllabic ending see on Aen.
1. 105.

483 meliorem animam] ‘A better life.' So Aen. xii. 296, Hoc habet:
haec melior magnis data victima dz'vz's (Messapus over the slain Aulestes).

The most probable explanation is that of Turnebus, viz. that melior was a ν
technical word sor a substituted victim (the Greek formula in suchcases ¹
was δευτέρων ἀμεινόνων, as it were, ‘ second thoughts are best ⁹). ‘ Better ’

than a human xdctim’ is a sentiment worthy of V., but quite out of char-
acter. ‘ Better than that battered prize-fighter‚’ on the other hand, is
quite in the vein of Entellus, but hardly suits the calm dignity with which
V. makes him leave the stage.

[485-544. The archery match. A dove tied to a mast is the butt.
Hippocoon hits the mast, Mnestheus cuts the cord, Eurytion kills the
bird. Lastly, Acestes fires into the air and his arrow vanishes in fire.
Aeneas welcomes the good omen, and awards the prizes: to Acestes

the first]

487 ingenti manu] ‘With his own strong hand.' Translated from

Il. xxiii. 852: ἱστὸν δ’ ἔστησεν νηὸς κυανοπρώροιο Τηλοῦ ἐπὶ ψαμάθοις·
ἐκ δὲ τρήρωνα πέλειαν Λεπτῇ μηρίνθῳ δῆσεν ποδὸς, ἧς ἄρ’ ἀνώγει Tegeum.

488 traiecto 111 fune] ‘ On (by) a rope passed across (tied round) the
bird.’

490 sorte] ‘The lot‚' the English idiom agreeing. Homer, loc. cit„ Α

has κλήρους.

496 Pandarus] The famous Trojan archer, who, at the bidding of ”

Pallas, shoots an arrow at Menelaus, and so breaks the truce. Iliad
iv. 88 seq.
