255-284] BOOK V.

feet and snatched alost from Ida. Papillon‚ however, may be right in
connecting praepes ab Ida, ‘ swooping down from Ida.’

²55 armiger] Cf. Horace, Od. iii. 1.‚ ministrum fulminis alitem, and
. Ovid, Met. xii. 560, volucris quae fulmine curvis ferre solet pedibus.
Pliny, Hist. Nat. ii. 55, rationalises‚ ‘The eagle alone of birds is not
struck by thunder‚ hence it is said to be the bearer of thunderbolts.'

rapuit] The change of tense helps to distinguish the two pictureS.

saevitque] ‘ His hounds with savage bark howl at the sky.’

259] ‘ A hauberk woven of polished links, thrice threaded with
gold.' The links or hooks, and the triple leashes (licia) of gold are iden-
tical. The cuirass was probably not a piece of chain—armour‚ but formed
of small plates of steel joined by gold wire, as is shown by its weight.

261 sub 1110 alto] The hiatus and shortening of one vowel before
another in arsi is a Greek licence, used sparingly by V., mostly with
proper names. Cf. Aen. iii. 211, Insulae Ionio in magno.

260 connixi humeris] ‘On their straining shoulders.' Cf. Aen. ix.
410, tolo connixus corpore.

265 eursu agebat] ‘ would drive in hot pursuit.’

267 aspera sig-nis] ‘Embossed with figures.' Cf. Ovid, Alet. xii. 235,
signis exstantibus asper Crater.

268. Iamque adeo] Adeo, like the Greek δή, emphasises the word it
follows. 1t is thus used by V. aster pronouns (tuque adeo, Geor. i. 24 ;
haec adeo, Aen. xi. 275), adverbs (here and ii. 567), numerals (Tres adeo
soles, iii. 230), and adjectives (totae adeo, xii. 548).

269 taenis] The contracted form of taeniis.

271 ordine debilis uno] ‘ Crippled in one tier of oars.’

273 viae in aggere] ‘ On the crown of the highway.' The Roman
roads were solid bits of masonry built up above the level of the plain.

276] ‘ Writhes all its length in vain attempts to fly.' ⁷

dat tortus] :torquet se. So dare ruinam (Aen. iii. 210)=ruere; dare
motus (Geor. i. 350) :movere se.

277 ferox] Approaches here the meaning of ferus, but still to be dis·
tinguished ; not ‘ fierce ’ but ‘ defiant,' ‘ fighting bravely to the end.'

nixantem nodis] ‘ Struggling with its coils,’ tle. trying to work itself
on by help of its coils. Some MS. have nexantem nodt'53 when we must
understand from the next clause se, ‘ twining itself in its coils,' a Vergilian
variation, as C. remarks, sor nexantem nodos.

280 tali remigio] ‘ So with her oarage.'

282 promisso munere] In l. 70 all are promised rewards according to
their deserts, but it is not till l. 305 that we learn by inserence from the
foot-race that every competitor was to receive a prize. This indirect
narrative, as C. remarks, is quite ln V. 's style.

284 operum nand ignara minervae] From Il. xxii. 263, where the

victor receives a woman, ἀμύμονα ἔργ’ εἰδυῖαν, skilled in carding wool and
weaving.
