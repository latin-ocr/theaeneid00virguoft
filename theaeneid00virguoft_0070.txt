upon circle, boy warriors calling up a phantom image of war.’ 1 agree
with C. that V. ’s words become purposely indefinite at this point, and it
would be idle to attempt a diagram. Heniy is sar too explicit,rbut he is
right in explaining impediunt of circle meeting circle, or rather one
Section of a circle meeting the other, and so preventing the completion of
the circles. See, however, sourmzl of Plzz'lology, vol. ix. No. 17, p. 101.

594] After the simile of the labyrinth, which gives the intricacy of the ⁴

dolphins. (Abridged from Henry.) Ξ

600 porro] ‘Straight on,’ ‘in succession.’

601 honorem] The rite3 see on Aen. i. 48. j
