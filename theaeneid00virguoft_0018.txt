The burning of the ships was also a part of the

primitive legend. As told by Aristotleflche scene is'

laid in Latium, and the burning of the ships by Trojan
captives in order to escape the slavery that awaited
them in Greece leads directly to the founding of Rome.
Vergil transfers the scene to Sicily for the general
reason above given, and perhaps with the special
object of incorporating the tradition which ascribed a
common parentage to Romans and SegestanS. The
loss of PalinurUS, with which the book closeS, serves to
give incident to an otherwise uneventful voyage, and
incorporates the legend connected ,with the promontory
which bore the pilot's name. The more elaborate
account of his death, as given by his shade in the Sixth
Book, is widely different from that in the Fifth Book,
and is one of the most conspicuous discrepancieS, which
would certainly have been removed in a final revision

of the poem.
