NOTES TO VERGIL’SAENEID. Α[52-66 q?

52 Mycenae] Follows the Greek form Μυκήνη; the plural Mycenae is -
the common form in Latin. For the genitive cf. urbem Patavi, Aen.
i. 247 ; urbem T ny'ae, i. 565. Generally the name is in apposition.

53 ordine] Adverbially, as iii. 548.

pompas] Especially of a funeral procession.

54 strueremque] ‘And pile the altars with their proper gists.' For
the emphatic smcs cf. Aen. iii. 469, sunt et sua dona parenti.

55 ultro] Properly ‘to a point beyond‚' so beyond expectation‚ of uu-
solicited‚ spontaneous acts. Cf. Aen. ii. 145, His lacrimis vitam damus
et miserescimus ultro (‘ We grant his life, and go so far as to pity him ’ ;
Horace, Epist. i. 12. 22, Sz' quid petit ultro αἐβεν(ι anticip'ate his request ').
Here the meaning is, ‘So far from being wretched wanderers, we are
actually at the tomb.'

ipsius] virtually :iffi-os, C.

56] ‘ Not as l deem without the eounsel and purpose of the gods’=
Homer’s οὐκ ἀέκητι θεῶν.

58] ‘Let us all with joyful accord observe the rites.’ For honor see
Aen. i. 48. Ι
59 poscamus ventos] ‘ Pray we the winds’ (Morris); ‘ ask at his tomb
for a fair sea-wind,' Bowen. The latter interpretation is favoured by Lac-
tantius, who says of Anchises: ‘cuz' Aeneas non tantum immortalitatem
verum etiam ventorum tribuit potestatem? On the other hand, we find
that a sacrifice is offered to the winds themselves after the funeral games,
l. 772, and the closely parallel placemus ven-tos of Aen. iii. 115 turns the

balance 1n sav our of the former interpretation.

60 velit]‘ May he deign,' an optative. This is better than to take
velzt as oblique petition: Poscamus ventos atque poscamus velet, a mixed
construction. Note how craftily the real prayer, that he may found a
city, is insinuated‚ as it were, in a side—clause.

61 bina boum capita] ‘Two head of cattle apiece.' Cf. triginta
capitmnfetus, Aen. iii. 391. The Latin and English idiom exactly corre· 2
spond.

62 adhibete] The regular word in rituals for invoking the presence of
the god to a feast. Cf. Hor. Od. iv. 5. 31, et alteras te mensis adhibet .
deum. ¹

Penates] The gods not only of the priv ate household, but of the nation 'i
considered as a family. ΝΝ,1)εῐι as in this case, the nation splits up and‘
founds separate settlements, each branch has its own Penates. i

64 si . . . extulerit] We should have expected‘ When the ninth daytj
dawns‚’ but the sz' implies‘ if we live to see the ninth day. ' The Roman ⁴
custom was to mourn sor a week, then on the eighth day the body was
burned, and on the ninth (novemdiale) the funeral feast and games.

63 radiisque retexerit orbem] Repeated from iv. 119, ‘ and unveil the ·-
world with his rays.’ Cf. iam rebus luce retectis, Aen. ix. 461.

66] ‘I with a race of vessels will open the Trojan games' (Bowen).
