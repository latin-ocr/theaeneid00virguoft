’ ’ 67-85] BOOK V.

Cf. Geor. ii. 530, Velocis iaculi certamina ponit in ulmo. Instead of
deinde to correspond to prima, we have que, aut.

67 quique] = et illi qui.

68 aut] Corresponds irregularly with seu ; so Aen. xii. 685, we have
seu . . . aul.

incedit] :jactat se, ‘ Advances as a champion. '

jaculo] The javelin contest is not carried out.

69 crudo] ‘ Raw‚’ i. e. of untanned hide. See description of the caestus,
l. 403.

nditJ=audet‚ hence the infinitive.

71 ore favete] ‘favour me with your mouths‘=‘join with me in the
ritual,' then ‘speak none but religious words‚’ and so (like the Greek
εὐφημεῖτε) ‘keep silence.' Thus the phrase has two almost contradictory
meanings. Henry contends that the meaning here is ‘ Rejoiee with me‚'

⁷ and quotes from Ovid, Ibis, 98 :—

Quisquis ades sacris, ore favete, meis ;
Quisquis ades sacris, lugubria dicite verba,

’ where it certainly means ‘mourn with me.' We must leave the point

doubtful, and be content to say that the formula signifies the beginning of
a religious service, and, like the ‘Let us pray' of the English Church
Service, may signify either that the congregation is silent or accompanies
the minister.

[72-103. Aeneas, with the populace, proceeds to his father's tomb, and
addresses his shade. A serpent issues from the tomb and tastes the
libations. Further gifts are offered to the dead. A banquet follows]

72 materna . . . myrto] The myrtle sacred to Venus.

73 Helymus] A Trojan follower of Acestes, the ἥρως ἐπώνυμος os the
Elymi, a Sicilian tribe.

77 carchesia] Tankards, shaped somewhat like a dice-box.

79 purpureos] ‘ Bright,’ not only ‘ purple.’

80] Some place the semicolon before ilerum, but it is better to refer it
to Aeneas’ second visit.

recepti nequiquam emeres] ‘ Ashes of one whom vainly I rescued once
from the flames ’ (Bowen). But recepti is not genitive singular. The iden-
tification of the ashes or shade with the living man is quite natural.

animaeque umbraeque] C. suggests that the plural may follow the
analogy of manes3 cf. iv. 571.

82 fatalia] ‘Destined.'

83 quicumque est] ‘ Is such there be.' Sidgwick remarks the dramatic
irony with which the hero is made to speak thus of the most famous river
of all the world. λ

85] ‘ Amid sevenfold masses of coil, sliding in seven great rings ’

(Bowen). A translation which brings out admirably the force of ingms in
its collocation.
