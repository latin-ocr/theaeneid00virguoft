NOTES To VERGJL’S AENEJD ἡ [331·359

ubi, as does Catullus, xi. 3: Sive ad extremos penetrabit Indos, Litus ut
longe resonante an Tunditur unda. Servius says that funeral gam&
were always preceded by a sacrifice, but V. may refer to the oxen
slaughtered nine days before, l. 97.

331] ‘The youth, as he trod, kept not his feet on the treacherous soil’
(Bowen).

332 titubata] As if from a deponent titubor, which is not found.

336 me] See on Aen. i. 3. Amorum, poetical plural, as Aen. iv. 28.
To take it as=amati (Geor. iii. 227) weakens the pathos of the line,
‘Rolled over and lay stretched on the thick sand.' iacuit, more
forcible than concidit. ⁸

arena may, as XVagnen vsuggest a reminiscence of the circus, οι·

τῖε may suppose a sandy meadow, such as would be sound near the sea·
s ore.

339. et nunc tertia palma Diores] ‘And Diores now a third,’ having
been fifth at starting. The identification of the prize-winner with the
prize is too natural to need comment.

340 ora prima patrum] ‘ The upturned faces of the elders in the front
rOW,’ but, as C. remarks, the combination with implet is harsh. We may
justify it as a case of zeugma. ‘He fills the whole assembly with his
complaints, and upbraids the elders to their face.’ The elders sit in
from, as in a Roman theatre ; the senators occupy the prima subsellia.

343 favor] Sc. spectantium.

344 ‘ And worth more winning in a winsome form.'

veniens] ‘ Presenting itself,' almost like the French pre'venant.

345 proclamat] ‘ Makes appeaL'

346 subiit palmae] ‘ Has attained a prize '; as we say, ‘come in for a
prize.' The co-ordinate sentence further defines the statement in V.’s
usual way.

347 reddantur] The MSS. vary between reddantur, redduntur, and
reddentur. Ribbeck, with Ρ., adopts the last, most other commentators
the reading of the text. The sentence passes from the direct to the

oblique. That Diores had won the third place is told as a fact. The -

condition that would rob him of his prize is given as a part of his plea.

In prose we should have had qui subierit . . . venerit. Sidgwick explains ⁷

the subjunctive by supposing an ellipse, qui ad praemia veuit frustraque
venerit si, etc.

350 me] Emphasised not only by its position, but as substituted for

the ordinary dative. ‘ My personal feelings will not interfere with your ,

just rewards. '

355 laude] ‘Praise, ' for ‘what merits praise, ' ‘merit. ' Common in *

V. as Aen. i. 461, ix, 252.
358 Risit 0111] ‘Smiled on him,' as Buc. iv, 62, cui non rzsere parentes.
‘Laughed at him’ would be zrrisz't illi or rzsit illum.
359 Didymaonis] An unknown artist.
